# Sentiment-Analysis
Repo for a model that analyzes sentiments in comments

# Overview
* The repo provides an output of either positive, neutral, or negative sentiments based on the comments reviewers leave about the app.
* Libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob and wordcloud
* The model compares the ratings users gave the app to the results of sentiment analysis to understand if the comments translate to the ratings
* A word cloud is generated for the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments respectively

# Notes
* Although a specific data set is used for this model, it can be easily altered to cater for other datasets
* Data was acquired from www.statso.io
