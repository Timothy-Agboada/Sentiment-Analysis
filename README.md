# Sentiment-Analysis
Repo for a model that analyzes sentiments in comments

# Overview
 The repo provides an output of either positive, neutral, or negative sentiments based on the comments reviewers leave about the app.
 Libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob and wordcloud
 The model compares the ratings users gave the app to the results of sentiment analysis to understand if the comments translate to the ratings
 A word cloud is generated for the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments respectively

# Notes
 Although a specific data set is used for this model, it can be easily altered to cater for other datasets
 Data was acquired from www.statso.io
